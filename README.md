# Slot-Machine-Game
This is a java project utilizing multiple cases and handling user input in a persistent loop.

I made this slot machine game to learn how to micromanage persistent do loops that had multiple cases to check individual results/actions.
The slot machine accurately handles the "money" and ends the loop if it detects none remaining.
Initializing a ton of characters may seem weird but it was a specification the project asked for, so I acquiesced.
